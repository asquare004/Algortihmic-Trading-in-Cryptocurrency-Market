# Algorithmic Trading in Cryptocurrency Market

I had to build some models for Algorithmic Trading in Cryptocurrency Market during Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2024. Since then, I have been trying to build more models and compare their performances by backtesting. This repository contains some of the models I have experimented so far.
